## 🎯 Key Insights Summary

### The One Equation
```
Score = Similarity × Freshness × Quality × Diversity × Velocity
```

### The Three Laws
1. **Embedding Gravity** - Engagement attracts content and users together
2. **Velocity Decay** - Time kills momentum; only fast engagement overcomes decay
3. **Quality Equilibrium** - System self-corrects toward quality through negative actions

### What the Algorithm Wants
> Maximize engagement velocity while maintaining feed quality and diversity
